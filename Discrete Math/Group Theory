Group theory is very important mathematical tool which is used in a number of areas in research and application. Using group theory, we can estimate the strength of a set with respect to an operator. This idea will further help us in research field to identify the correct mathematical system to work in a particular research area. E.g. can we use natural numbers in complex problem area like soft computing or studying black holes.

## 1. Closure property 
Consider a non-empty set A and a binary operation $*$ on $A$. $A$ is said to be closed with respect $*$, if $\forall a, b \in A, \text{ then } a*b \in A$.
## Algebraic Structure
A non-empty set $A$ is said to be an algebraic structure with respect to a binary operation $*$, if $A$ satisfy closure property with respect to $*$.


## 2. Associative property
 Consider a non-empty set A and a binary operation $*$ on A. A is said to be associative with respect to $*$, if $\forall a, b, c \in A$, then  $(a* b) * c = a*(b* c)$
## Semi-Group
A non-empty set $A$ is said to be a Semi-group with respect to a binary operation$*$, if A satisfy closure, Associative property with respect to $*$.


## 3. Identity property 
Consider a non-empty set A and a binary operator $*$ on $A$, $A$ is said to satisfy identity property with respect to $*$, if $\forall a\in A$, there must be unique $e\in A$, such that $a*e = e*a=a$.
There is exactly one identity element in the set and will be same for all element in the set.
## Monoid
A non-empty set $A$ is said to be a Monoid with respect to a binary operation $*$, if A satisfy closure, Associative, identity property with respect to $*$.


## 4. Inverse property
Consider a non-empty set $A$ and a binary operation $*$ on $A$. $A$ is said to satisfy inverse property with respect to $*$ if $\forall a \in A$, there must be unique element $a^{-1}\in A$, such that $a\times a^{-1}=a^{-1}*a = e$
1. Every element has a exactly one unique inverse which is also present in the same set.
2. If a is the inverse of b, then b will be inverse one a.
3. No two elements can have the same inverse
4. Identity element is its own inverse.
## Group
A non-empty set $A$ is said to be a group with respect to a binary operation $*$, if $A$ satisfy closure, Associative, identity, inverse property with respect to $*$.


## Commutative property
Consider a non-empty set A and a binary operation $*$ on $A$. $A$ is said to satisfy commutative property with respect to $*$, if $\forall a, b \in A$ , such that $a\times b = b\times a$.
## Abelian Group
A non-empty set $A$ is said to be a group with respect to a binary operation $*$, if A satisfy closure, Associative, identity, inverse, commutative property with respect to $*$.
